### Abstract
FASTmovers is a smart point system which is developed to tackle the inconveniences of students of FAST in specific and for all Karachiites as whole. Including students there are thousands of daily travelers in Karachi and the condition of public transport is pathetic. It is obvious that university point service is way better comparatively but still it is not up to the mark. I and many others faced the issue that we missed the point in early morning. And, in evening we have to wait for point departure till 4 pm. Using FASTmovers one can daily reserve a seat for morning or evening according to his or her convenient timings; moreover, pick up and destination is also considered. This will give a better traveling experience and is also economically beneficial.
